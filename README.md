# Illum

This is a joint project to develop a web page for the functional
programming group, Lambda Luminaries.

It is developed in Haskell, specifically the
[Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/) web framework and the initial commit
is based on this
[tutorial](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/).

Feel free to contribute.


## Things to do:
1. Get some sort of authentication working.
2. Integrate with Meetup API, RSS or similar.
3. Page for posting and categorizing useful links.

## License
Feel free to do whatever you like.
